## Add a comment indicating the reason for each rejected dependency upgrade added to this list, and what should be done to resolve it (i.e. handle it through a story, etc).
reject: [
  "eslint", # typescript-eslint v7 only supports eslint v8
  "ilp-packet", # peg this to same version as sdk-standard-components
  "typescript", # @typescript-eslint/parser only supports typescript 5.7. Need to wait for the new version of this component and then we can update typescript.
  "typedoc", # "typedoc-theme-hierarchy" requires typedoc@"^0.26.0 || ^0.27.0"
]
